        I am enrolled at Exeter University working remotely on my doctoral
        research under the supervision of Professor Samantha Hurn
        [http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/sociology/staff/hurn/] and part of
        the EASE (Exeter Anthrozoology as Symbiotic Ethics) working group
        [https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/ease/people/yancendiemberger/ ].

        The title of my doctoral thesis is: “To speak “Horse” in the Himalayas
        and Argentina: to what extent does communication between humans and
        horses depend on a “language”, and how does this manifest in different
        cultural contexts?”
      </div>
      <div className="text">
        How does “culture” and human-human language influence horse-human
        communication? What does this say about “universal” ethological claims
        on horse-horse behaviour?
      </div>
      <div className="text">
        This research project explores how horses and humans communicate through
        anthropology and ethology. It investigates how horses and humans
        communicate, examining what this might reveal about how humans make
        “horses”, and how horses might in turn make “humans”, in different
        contexts. This project uses English, Spanish, Tibetan, Nepali and
        “Horse” to investigate these questions.
      </div>
      <div className="text">
        To approach this, I research horse “taming” in two sites linked through
        their equine logics rather than socioeconomic or migratory histories:
        Traslasierra, Argentina, where temperamento, miedo, y cosquillas
        (temperament, fear, and ticklishness) are said to dictate human-horse
        interaction, and Limi, Nepal, where vocal commands are key to
        trans-species collaboration. Comparing analyses of human-horse
        interactions in these sites, I investigate what differences and
        similarities in training techniques reveal about the general question of
        horse-human communication, and the contexts in which they are embedded.
        Critically engaging with translations between Spanish, Tibetan, Nepali,
        English, ‘Horse’, and their local variants also allows de-centring of
        the English language and verbal language, both of which often remain
        assumed and unquestioned in much contemporary research. As I have lived
        and worked in both sites, the idea to carry out this investigation is a
        product of pre-existing connections and part of a wider multi-temporal
        fieldwork. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pI3NEu6FPM&t=27s ]

        The Tibetan Horse-science Manuscript [Two illuminated folios of vol.
        1277]
      </h2>
      <div className="text">
        While studying in Vienna my friend Michela Clemente, curator of the
        Tucci Tibetan collection preserved at the “Biblioteca IsIAO” – Sala
        delle collezioni africane and orientali
        (https://www.ismeo.eu/isiao-library/) within the Biblioteca Nazionale
        Centrale of Rome, told me about a beautifully illustrated Tibetan
        manuscript on horses that was unstudied. Fascinated by the idea of this
        text, I began working on it as soon as access was granted. This
        manuscript on Tibetan horse-science is an illuminated compilation
        tentatively dated to the 18th century, including texts from as early as
        the 9th century. It is one of the few stitched books (tib. ‘go tshem)
        included in the collection. It presents a challenging translation
        project and I have been working on it with the help of other Tibetan,
        and non-Tibetan experts (e.g., Dr. Petra Maurer, Dr. Hildegard
        Diemberger, and Ngawang Tseten). I co-authored a paper on the
        preliminary research at TibSTAT in the University of Sorbonne, Paris,
        during the final year of my undergraduate degree. I am currently working
        on this manuscript as a supporting resource for my PhD project mentioned
        above, however, I hope to undertake the full translation project in the
        near future.
